			<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
			<p>
				When we talked on Tuesday, we went over a variety of badass things. We
				talked about some tools a developer uses:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Terminal</li>
				<li>Homebrew</li>
				<li>git</li>
				<li>Node</li>
				<li>npm</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We talked about GitHub, which you just used to install this website. We
				also talked about <code>live-server</code> which is a development
				dependency that makes developing websites easier. We talked about git
				and you made your first git repo and first git commit.
			</p>
			<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
			<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
			<img src="img/terminal.png" />
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				Terminal is a macOS program that lets you interact with the computer via
				text commands. Because macOS and Linux are related to UNIX, an operating
				system from the past times, the stuff Terminal runs is sometimes called
				UNIX or *NIX (as in UNIX/Linux). Googling for instance "opening a
				directory UNIX" will give you a lot of Terminal related results. It's
				also important to know that, while Linux is different from macOS in many
				ways, lots of times tools and commands that you find that are for Linux,
				will also work in macOS.
			</p>
			<p>
				We talked about <code>man</code> pages and <code>--help</code>. These
				are common UNIX ways of getting more information about a command line
				program. You could type <code>man git</code>, or
				<code>git --help</code> to see its <code>man</code> page.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				We used Terminal to install Homebrew. We used Homebrew in Terminal to
				install various things, more on that later.
			</p>
			<p>We also went over a few UNIX commands:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>ls</code> <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>ts the
					directories and files in the working directory. It takes some options,
					which you indicate by adding a space, a dash and some letters.
					<code>ls</code> takes a bunch of options including <code>a</code> and
					<code>l</code>. <code>ls -a</code> indicates that we want to list
					directories <strong>including</strong> hidden directories.
					<code>ls -l</code> indicates that we want to list all directories in a
					formatted table with some extra information. We also combined these
					two options! You can combine any options together:
					<code>ls -la</code> or <code>ls -al</code>. We also used an argument
					to look inside a specific folder. If you follow <code>ls</code> with
					at directory name, you will list the files and directories in that
					directory. <code>ls ~/GitHub</code> should list the files and
					directories in your new GitHub folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>pwd</code> shows the <strong>p</strong>ath to
					<strong>w</strong>orking <strong>d</strong>irectory. Type
					<code>pwd</code> to find out where in your computer you are!
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>cd</code> <strong>c</strong>hanges the working
					<strong>d</strong>irectory. <code>cd</code> is followed by the name of
					the directory you want to enter. I've been sort of implying something
					in the README and in the <code>ls</code> command above with all this
					<code>~</code> talk. When a command takes a file or directory as an
					argument, you can usually refer to it in one of two ways. With an
					<strong>absolute</strong> path, or with a
					<strong>relative</strong> path. An absolute path starts with the root
					of your whole file system, <strong>/</strong>. A relative path starts
					with the name of a folder in the current working directory.
					<strong>~</strong> is short for an absolute path to your home folder.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>
			<img src="img/Homebrew.svg" />
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				Homebrew is a package manager. It downloads, stores and updates packages
				for you. It makes is easy to download all the stuff you would need as a
				developer.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				If you are installing a console program, you can type
				<code>brew install</code> and then the name of the program. If you are
				installing a program that has a GUI, you need to use brew cask:
				<code>brew install</code> and then then name of the program.
			</p>
			<p>
				We used brew cask to install Visual Studio Code, our code editor:
				<code>brew cask install visual-studio-code</code>. We also installed
				Node and it's package manager, npm: <code>brew install node</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We talked about verifying that a command line tool had been installed by
				entering <code>which</code> followed by the name of the program.

			<h2 id="git">git</h2>
			<img src="img/git.png" />
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				git is helpful for tracking changes made by you and others in a project
				and it has all kind of handy functions for returning to old states of
				work and creating branches so that you can work on something without
				interfering with the rest of the code base.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				We initialized a git repository with <code>git init</code>. We made some
				changes to our code and then, when we were ready to commit those changes
				to the repository, We used git status to see which files we wanted to
				commit. When we saw that node_modules was being considered "untracked"
				by git, we created and then added them to our .gitignore file so that
				git would not commit them or add them to staging.
			</p>
			<p>
				We staged our changes with
				<code>git add -A</code>. Notice the -A here, which is really similar to
				the -l, -a, or -la options that we gave to ls. In this case A means, add
				all untracked or unstaged code to staging so that we can review it and
				commit it. We checked <code>git status</code> again to make sure that
				the files in stage were the files we wanted to commit and then we
				committed them with <code>git commit -m</code> followed by a short
				message describing what is in the commit we were making.

			<h2 id="node">Node</h2>
			<img src="img/node.png" />
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				We didn't talk too much about Node and what it is. It is a JavaScript
				runtime build on Chrome's "V8" JavaScript engine. What that means
				exactly will become clearer later on as you start writing more
				JavaScript.
			</p>
			<h2 id="npm">npm</h2>
			<img src="img/npm.png" />
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				Like Homebrew, npm is a package manager. It stands for
				<strong>N</strong>ode <strong>P</strong>ackage <strong>M</strong>anager.
				npm is responsible for downloading dependencies for you projects, and
				maintaining your package.json file. Ultimately, it can be used to
				publish projects that you work on in the npm repository for others to
				download and use.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				We use <code>npm init</code> to start a new Node project. We were taken
				through a few prompts that had us set up things like the name of the
				project, the author, and the kind of license it should use. When we were
				done, we had a new package.json file.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also used npm to install a development dependency, live-server. We
				did this with the command <code>npm install -D live-server</code>. This
				useful utility creates a server on your computer that automatically
				detects changes to files on your project and reloads itself so you can
				always see the latest version of what you are working on.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not have direct access to live-server, however, so we added a
				script called "start" to our package.json and told npm that we wanted it
				to use live-server on our project directory when we ran that start
				script. We ran that script with <code>npm run start</code> and verified
				that it worked.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also saw that our package.json was keeping track of this dependency
				under a section called "devDependencies", which is for dependencies that
				make development easier, but won't be used when we deploy code to
				production.

			</div>
			<h1 id="websites">Websites</h1>
			<h2 id="mdn">MDN</h2>
			<img src="img/mdn.png" />
			<p>
				MDN is an authoritative reference for HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the
				browser. Sites like W3 School have information but it isn't always
				accurate. Plus, Mozilla is just a great organization!
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use the site to look up things like what a tag or css property
				is. They also have great tutorials you can follow that will give you a
				good sense of different technologies. Their
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">
					web development tutorials </a
				>w have a lot of great information for learning about what being a web
				dev entails.
			</p>
			<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
			<img src="img/Octocat.png" />
			<p>
				Have a git repository on your computer is great, but if you want to work
				with other developers, you have to be able to share it with them. GitHub
				lets you host remote repositories that are accessible to others.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's important to remember, as you make changes to your local
				repository, that you need to push to GitHub with <code>git push</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Their bizarre mascot is called "Octocat" and, presumably, is what
				happens when a cat and an octopus decide to get freaky.
			</p>
			<h1 id="altdobe">Altdobe</h1>
			<p>
				When I was first learning web development, I got a real kick out of the
				design part of it. I ended up wanting something like the Adobe Creative
				Suite, but there was no way on this earth I was going to pay a huge
				monthly fee for some software I was going to use casually once and
				awhile.
			</p>
			<p>
				After some research I discovered that while Photoshop and Illustrator
				might be the industry standard, but there are solid alternatives, both
				free and not. If doing some visual design is interesting to you, these
				might be helpful.
			</p>
			<h2 id="foss-altdobe">Free and Open Source</h2>
			<h3>GIMP</h3>
			<img src="img/gimp.png" />
			<p>
				GIMP comes preinstalled on many Linux distros, and it's a standard for
				editing photos in the Free and Open Source ("FOSS") community. I've
				found it's interface to be decent, and it's powerful enough for most of
				your photo and pixel editing needs. This is the FOSS answer to
				Photoshop.
			</p>
			<h3>Inkscape</h3>
			<img src="img/inkscape.png" />
			<p>
				Like GIMP, Inkscape is the standard in the FOSS community for making
				illustrations. It's a FOSS alternative to Illustrator. I personally find
				its interface annoying and I don't like it. Maybe given time, I would
				come around, though. And it is free!
			</p>
			<h2 src="paid-altdobe">Less expensive, less evil, but not free</h2>
			<h3>Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo</h3>
			<img src="img/affinity.svg" />
			<p>
				Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo are pretty new pieces of design
				software. I've been using them since they were in beta, and they've come
				a long way. They have most of the power of Adobe products, but they are
				about $50 each. I love them, and if you feel like Inkscape and GIMP
				aren't cutting it, these are definitely worth a look.
			</p>
			<p>
				Likely Designer is all you would need. It has some pixel/photo editing
				abilities, but is mostly competing with Illustrator. If you find you
				want to do more powerful photo editing, though, Affinity Photo is great.
			</p>
			<h3>Sketch</h3>
			<img src="img/sketch.png" />
			<p>
				Sketch is a macOS app that is really big in the UI/UX design community.
				It's roughly like Illustrator but geared toward building UI/UX elements.
				I have never used it, but I've heard good things about it, and it's a
				well regarded program.
