			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
				When we talked on Tuesday, we went over a variety of badass things. We
				talked about some tools a developer uses:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Terminal</li>
				<li>Homebrew</li>
				<li>git</li>
				<li>Node</li>
				<li>npm</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We talked about GitHub, which you just used to install this website. We
				also talked about <code>live-server</code> which is a development
				dependency that makes developing websites easier.
			</p>
			<h1>Tools</h1>
			<p>
				Let's review the tools!
			</p>
			<h2>Terminal</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				Terminal is a macOS program that lets you interact with the computer via
				text commands. Because macOS and Linux are related to UNIX, an operating
				system from the past times, the stuff Terminal runs is sometimes called
				UNIX or *NIX (as in UNIX/Linux). Googling "opening a directory UNIX"
				will give you a lot of Terminal related results.
			</p>
			<p>
				We talked about <code>man</code> pages and <code>--help</code>. These
				are common UNIX ways of getting more information about a command line
				program. You could type <code>man git</code>, or
				<code>git --help</code> to see its <code>man</code> page.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				We used Terminal to install Homebrew. We used Homebrew in Terminal to
				install various things, more on that later.
			</p>
			<p>We also went over a few UNIX commands:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>ls</code> <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>ts the
					directories and files in the working directory. It takes some options,
					which you indicate by adding a space, a dash and some letters.
					<code>ls</code> takes a bunch of options including <code>a</code> and
					<code>l</code>. <code>ls -a</code> indicates that we want to list
					directories <strong>including</strong> hidden directories.
					<code>ls -l</code> indicates that we want to list all directories in a
					formatted table with some extra information. We also combined these
					two options! You can combine any options together:
					<code>ls -la</code> or <code>ls -al</code>. We also used an argument
					to look inside a specific folder. If you follow <code>ls</code> with
					at directory name, you will list the files and directories in that
					directory. <code>ls ~/GitHub</code> should list the files and
					directories in your new GitHub folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>pwd</code> shows the <strong>p</strong>ath to
					<strong>w</strong>orking <strong>d</strong>irectory. Type
					<code>pwd</code> to find out where in your computer you are!
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>cd</code> <strong>c</strong>hanges the working
					<strong>d</strong>irectory. <code>cd</code> is followed by the name of
					the directory you want to enter. I've been sort of implying something
					in the README and in the <code>ls</code> command above with all this
					<code>~</code> talk. When a command takes a file or directory as an
					argument, you can usually refer to it in one of two ways. With an
					<strong>absolute</strong> path, or with a
					<strong>relative</strong> path. An absolute path starts with the root
					of your whole file system, <strong>/</strong>. A relative path starts
					with the name of a folder in the current working directory.
					<strong>~</strong> is short for an absolute path to your home folder.

			<h2>Homebrew</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				Homebrew is a package manager. It downloads, stores and updates packages
				for you. It makes is easy to download all the stuff you would need as a
				developer.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				If you are installing a console program, you can type
				<code>brew install</code> and then the name of the program. If you are
				installing a program that has a GUI, you need to use brew cask:
				<code>brew install</code> and then then name of the program.
			</p>
			<p>
				We used brew cask to install Visual Studio Code, our code editor:
				<code>brew cask install visual-studio-code</code>. We also installed
				Node and it's package manager, npm: <code>brew install node</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We talked about verifying that a command line tool had been installed by
				entering <code>which</code> followed by the name of the program.
			</p>
			<h2>git</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				git is helpful for tracking changes made by you and others in a project
				and it has all kind of handy functions for returning to old states of
				work and creating branches so that you can work on something without
				interfering with the rest of the code base.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				We initialized a git repository with <code>git init</code>. We made some
				changes to our code and then, when we were ready to commit those changes
				to the repository, We used git status to see which files we wanted to
				commit. When we saw that node_modules was being considered "untracked"
				by git, we created and then added them to our .gitignore file so that
				git would not commit them or add them to staging.
			</p>
			<p>
				We staged our changes with
				<code>git add -A</code>. Notice the -A here, which is really similar to
				the -l, -a, or -la options that we gave to ls. In this case A means, add
				all untracked or unstaged code to staging so that we can review it and
				commit it. We checked <code>git status</code> again to make sure that
				the files in stage were the files we wanted to commit and then we
				committed them with <code>git commit -m</code> followed by a short
				message describing what is in the commit we were making.

			<h2>Node</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				We didn't talk too much about Node and what it is. It is a JavaScript
				runtime build on Chrome's "V8" JavaScript engine. What that means
				exactly will become clearer later on as you start writing more
				JavaScript.
			</p>
			<h2>npm</h2>
			<h3>What is it?</h3>
			<p>
				Like Homebrew, npm is a package manager. It stands for
				<strong>N</strong>ode <strong>P</strong>ackage <strong>M</strong>anager.
				npm is responsible for downloading dependencies for you projects, and
				maintaining your package.json file. Ultimately, it can be used to
				publish projects that you work on in the npm repository for others to
				download and use.
			</p>
			<h3>How did we use it?</h3>
			<p>
				We use <code>npm init</code> to start a new Node project. We were taken
				through a few prompts that had us set up things like the name of the
				project, the author, and the kind of license it should use. When we were
				done, we had a new package.json file.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also used npm to install a development dependency, live-server. We
				did this with the command <code>npm install -D live-server</code>. This
				useful utility creates a server on your computer that automatically
				detects changes to files on your project and reloads itself so you can
				always see the latest version of what you are working on.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not have direct access to live-server, however, so we added a
				script called "start" to our package.json and told npm that we wanted it
				to use live-server on our project directory when we ran that start
				script. We ran that script with <code>npm run start</code> and verified
				that it worked.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also saw that our package.json was keeping track of this dependency
				under a section called "devDependencies", which is for dependencies that
				make development easier, but won't be used when we deploy code to
				production.
